@project_docs/START_HERE.md start by creating and checking out a new feature branch. Work on only one task from the TASKS.md file at a time. you may use sub-agents to speed up. Once a task is fully implemented and completed and validated all the acceptance and validation criteria, it must create a pull request for that feature and then stop for my review. Before you begin anything, read the @project_docs/TASKS.md  file all the way from the start to the beginning of your task.
