## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limit Errors

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "type": "rate_limit_error"
  }
}
```

**Solution**: XAI has rate limits. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.

### Authentication Errors

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key",
    "type": "authentication_error"
  }
}
```

**Solution**: Verify your XAI API key is correct and active.

### Model Availability

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Model not available",
    "type": "invalid_request_error"
  }
}
```

**Solution**: Check [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai) for model availability. Models may be in beta or temporarily unavailable.

### Content Restrictions

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Content violates usage policy",
    "type": "invalid_request_error"
  }
}
```

**Solution**: Modify your request to comply with XAI's usage policies.

### Real-Time Data Limitations

Some real-time queries may fail:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Unable to access real-time data",
    "type": "service_unavailable"
  }
}
```

**Solution**: Rephrase your query or try again later.
