---

## üéâ The Problem We All Face

You're deep into a project with Claude Code. Everything's flowing perfectly until...

- **Developer**: "I need Kimi K2's coding performance - it beats Claude Sonnet at 1/10th the cost!"
- **Marketer**: "This campaign needs Gemini's 1M token context for analyzing all our data"
- **Writer**: "I want to try OpenAI's o3 for this technical documentation - it's the best reasoning model out there!"

The frustration is real. You love Claude Code's capabilities and tool calling intelligence, but you're locked into one model. **Until now.**

## Introducing CCProxy Version 1.0

CCProxy is the bridge between Claude Code and the entire AI universe. Keep your workflow, expand your possibilities.

### For Developers: Technical Freedom

```bash
# Monday: Complex debugging with Claude

- **Qwen3 235B** for breakthrough mathematical reasoning (70.3 AIME)

The problem? **Switching between models means juggling multiple tools, APIs, and workflows.**

## Enter CCProxy: One Tool, Infinite Possibilities

CCProxy solves this fragmentation by transforming Claude Code into a **universal AI development platform**. With this release, we're not just fixing bugs ‚Äì we're revolutionizing how developers access AI.

### üîí Security First: Bulletproof Installation

We've completely rewritten our installation script to address critical security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Before: Vulnerable to injection attacks
VERSION=$(curl -s $API | grep tag_name | sed ...)

# After: Secure with validation
validate_version() {
    if [[ ! "$version" =~ ^v?[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$ ]]; then
        echo "Invalid version format"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```

**Key Security Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **GoSec security scans** on every commit
- ‚úÖ **Rigorous code reviews** for all changes
- ‚úÖ **Input validation** prevents URL injection attacks
- ‚úÖ **Explicit sudo consent** ‚Äì no silent privilege escalation
- ‚úÖ **Binary verification** ensures you're downloading legitimate executables
- ‚úÖ **Checksum validation** guarantees file integrity
- ‚úÖ **Secure temp files** with proper permissions (600/700)

### üéØ The Truth About Providers: 5 Direct, 100+ Through OpenRouter

We've corrected our documentation to be **completely transparent**:

**Directly Supported Providers (5):**
1. **Anthropic** - Native Claude support with full transformers
2. **OpenAI** - Complete GPT compatibility
3. **Google Gemini** - Full multimodal support
4. **DeepSeek** - Optimized for coding tasks
5. **OpenRouter** - Gateway to 100+ additional models

**No longer misleading users** about direct support for Groq, XAI, or Mistral. These are available through OpenRouter, giving you access to:
- **Kimi K2** via Groq's ultra-fast infrastructure
- **Grok** models for real-time data
- **Mistral** for European privacy compliance
- **100+ other models** from various providers

```json
// ‚ùå This DOESN'T work:
PROVIDER=groq GROQ_API_KEY=sk-... ccproxy start

// ‚úÖ This DOES work:
{
  "providers": [{
    "name": "openrouter",
    "api_key": "${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}",
    "enabled": true
  }]
}
```

We've created:
