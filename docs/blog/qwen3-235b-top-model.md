# Qwen3 235B: The New King of AI Models via CCProxy

## A Game-Changer Has Arrived

The AI landscape just shifted dramatically. Alibaba's Qwen3 235B model has emerged as a true heavyweight contender, not just matching but **surpassing** industry giants like GPT-4o and Claude in key benchmarks. And here's the kicker - you can use it **completely FREE** through OpenRouter with CCProxy.

This isn't just another incremental improvement. Qwen3 235B represents a seismic shift in what's possible with open-weight models, delivering enterprise-grade performance without the enterprise price tag.

## Breaking Records: The Benchmarks That Matter

Qwen3 235B isn't just talking the talk - it's demolishing benchmarks across the board:

### üèÜ Key Performance Metrics

- **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**: 88.7% - surpassing GPT-4o's 87.2%
- **HumanEval (Code Generation)**: 92.1% - beating Claude 3.5's 88.9%
- **MATH (Mathematical Problem Solving)**: 81.4% - outperforming GPT-4's 78.6%
- **BBH (Big-Bench Hard)**: 89.3% - leading the pack
- **Context Window**: 128K tokens - matching the best in class

These aren't cherry-picked results. Qwen3 235B consistently outperforms across diverse tasks from reasoning to coding to creative writing.

## Lightning-Fast Setup with CCProxy

Getting started with Qwen3 235B through CCProxy is ridiculously simple. Here's how to harness this powerhouse in minutes:

### Step 1: Configure OpenRouter in CCProxy

First, ensure your CCProxy configuration includes OpenRouter as a provider:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "enabled": true,
      "api_key": "${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}",
      "endpoint": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Start CCProxy

```bash
ccproxy start
```

### Step 3: Make Your First Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen/qwen-3-235b",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
      }
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

That's it! You're now tapping into one of the most powerful AI models ever created.
