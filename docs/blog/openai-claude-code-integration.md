## The Integration Challenge

### Different API Formats

Claude Code is designed to work with Anthropic's API format, while OpenAI uses a different API structure. This creates a compatibility issue when you want to use OpenAI models with Claude Code.

**The Problem:**
- Claude Code expects Anthropic's message format
- OpenAI uses a different request/response structure
- Tool calling (function calling) works differently between providers
- Manual integration requires significant development work

### The Solution: API Translation

CCProxy solves this by acting as a simple translation layer:

**What CCProxy Does:**
- **API Translation**: Converts between Anthropic and OpenAI API formats
- **Tool Support**: Translates tool calling between different formats
- **Request Routing**: Routes requests to different AI providers
- **Response Formatting**: Ensures responses match what Claude Code expects

**What CCProxy Doesn't Do:**
- No automatic failover or smart routing
- No cost optimization or analytics
- No complex orchestration features
- No caching or performance optimization

CCProxy is intentionally simple - it's just a proxy that translates API calls.

## CCProxy: The Simple Solution

### Seamless OpenAI Integration

Developed by Orchestre, CCProxy transforms OpenAI models into Claude Code-compatible endpoints:

```bash
# Traditional setup: Complex API integration required
# (Multiple files, custom code, ongoing maintenance)

# CCProxy setup: Simple proxy configuration
export PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ccproxy &

# Claude Code connects seamlessly
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456
claude "Help me debug this function"
```

### Single Provider Configuration

CCProxy focuses on simple, single-provider configuration:

```bash
# Configure for OpenAI
export PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Or configure for Groq
export PROVIDER=groq
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key

# Start the proxy
ccproxy
```

Note: CCProxy handles one provider at a time - you can switch providers by changing the configuration and restarting the proxy.

## Real-World Integration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Medical Professional Using OpenAI for Documentation

**The Situation:** Dr. Sarah, an emergency room physician, wants to use OpenAI's GPT-4 for creating patient discharge summaries while keeping her familiar Claude Code interface.

**The Challenge:**

export GROQ_MODEL=llama3-8b-8192

# Code review: Anthropic Claude
export PROVIDER=anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-sonnet-20240229
```

**Benefits:**
- **Experimentation:** Easy to test different models
- **Team consistency:** Everyone uses the same Claude Code interface
- **Flexible deployment:** Can be deployed with different configurations
- **Cost awareness:** Choose models based on budget and requirements

## Technical Deep Dive: OpenAI Integration

### API Compatibility Layer

CCProxy's OpenAI integration handles the essential translation between API formats:

```go
// Example: Converting Anthropic messages to OpenAI chat format
func ConvertAnthropicToOpenAI(req *models.MessagesRequest) (*models.ChatCompletionRequest, error) {
    chatReq := &models.ChatCompletionRequest{
        Model:       req.Model,
        MaxTokens:   req.MaxTokens,
        Temperature: req.Temperature,
    }
    
    // Convert messages from Anthropic format to OpenAI format
    messages, err := convertMessages(req.Messages)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    chatReq.Messages = messages
    
    // Convert tools if present
    if req.Tools != nil {
        tools, err := convertTools(req.Tools)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        chatReq.Tools = tools
    }
    
    return chatReq, nil
}
```

### Simple Model Configuration

CCProxy uses straightforward model selection based on environment variables:

```bash
# Configure the OpenAI model to use
export PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4

# Or specify a different model
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo

# CCProxy uses the configured model for all requests
ccproxy
```

The proxy doesn't make intelligent model selections - it simply uses the model you configure.

## Getting Started: Simple Setup Steps

### Basic OpenAI Setup

```bash
# Step 1: Install CCProxy
# Download from GitHub releases or build from source
wget https://github.com/orchestre-dev/ccproxy/releases/latest/download/ccproxy-linux-amd64
chmod +x ccproxy-linux-amd64

# Step 2: Configure OpenAI
export PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4

# Step 3: Start CCProxy
./ccproxy-linux-amd64

# Step 4: Configure Claude Code
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=NOT_NEEDED

# Step 5: Use Claude Code as normal

```

### Switching Between Providers

```bash
# To switch from OpenAI to Groq:
# Stop CCProxy (Ctrl+C)
export PROVIDER=groq
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
export GROQ_MODEL=llama3-8b-8192

# Restart CCProxy
./ccproxy-linux-amd64

# Claude Code automatically uses the new provider
```

### Docker Setup

```bash
# Create environment file
cat > .env << EOF
PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
EOF

# Run with Docker
docker run -p 3456:3456 --env-file .env orchestre/ccproxy:latest
```

## Cost Considerations

### Manual Provider Selection

CCProxy doesn't automatically optimize costs, but you can manually choose cost-effective providers:

```bash
# Groq is often more cost-effective for simple tasks
export PROVIDER=groq
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
export GROQ_MODEL=llama3-8b-8192

# OpenAI for more complex tasks requiring GPT-4
export PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4

# Choose based on your specific needs and budget
```

### Simple Cost Monitoring

Track your usage by monitoring the provider's native billing:

- **OpenAI**: Check your usage in the OpenAI dashboard
- **Groq**: Monitor costs in the Groq console
- **Anthropic**: Track usage in the Anthropic console

CCProxy itself doesn't provide usage analytics - it simply proxies requests to your chosen provider.

## Core Capabilities

### API Translation

CCProxy's main feature is translating between different API formats:

```bash
# What CCProxy does:
# 1. Receives Anthropic-format requests from Claude Code
# 2. Converts them to OpenAI-format requests
# 3. Sends requests to OpenAI API
# 4. Converts OpenAI responses back to Anthropic format
# 5. Returns formatted responses to Claude Code

# No complex routing or optimization - just translation
```

### Tool Support

CCProxy handles tool calling translation between providers:

```bash
# When Claude Code sends tool calls:
# 1. CCProxy converts Anthropic tool format to OpenAI function format
# 2. Sends function calls to OpenAI
# 3. Converts OpenAI function responses back to Anthropic tool format
# 4. Returns tool results to Claude Code

# This allows Claude Code's tool ecosystem to work with OpenAI models
```

## Security and Compliance

### API Key Management

CCProxy requires standard API key security practices:

```bash
# Store API keys securely
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Use environment variables, not hardcoded keys
# Consider using tools like HashiCorp Vault for production
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(vault kv get -field=api_key secret/openai)

# CCProxy doesn't store or manage keys - it just uses them
```

### Basic Security Considerations

- **Local operation**: CCProxy runs locally by default (localhost:3456)
- **No data storage**: CCProxy doesn't store requests or responses
- **Simple proxy**: Just forwards requests to the configured provider
- **Standard HTTPS**: Uses provider's native HTTPS endpoints

For production deployments, consider:
- Running CCProxy behind a reverse proxy
- Using proper firewall rules
- Regular API key rotation
- Monitoring access logs

## Performance Characteristics

### Simple Proxy Performance

CCProxy is designed to be a lightweight proxy with minimal overhead:

```bash
# Performance characteristics:
# - Low memory usage (~10-20MB)
# - Fast startup time (<100ms)
# - Minimal request latency (<10ms translation overhead)
# - Simple Go binary with no complex dependencies

# CCProxy doesn't include:
# - Built-in benchmarking tools
# - Response caching
# - Performance optimization features
# - Complex routing algorithms
```

### Provider-Specific Performance

Different providers have different performance characteristics:

- **OpenAI**: Reliable but can have variable response times
- **Groq**: Very fast inference, good for real-time applications
- **Anthropic**: Good balance of speed and capability

CCProxy doesn't optimize performance - it simply forwards requests to your chosen provider.

## Supported Providers

### Current Provider Support

CCProxy currently supports these providers:

```bash
# Available providers
export PROVIDER=openai      # OpenAI GPT models
export PROVIDER=groq        # Groq's fast inference

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### OpenAI Rate Limits

```bash
# CCProxy doesn't handle rate limiting - it forwards provider errors
# If you hit OpenAI rate limits, you'll see the error from OpenAI
# Solution: Wait for limits to reset or upgrade your OpenAI plan

# Check OpenAI rate limits in your OpenAI dashboard
```

### API Key Issues

```bash
# Common API key problems:

# 1. Invalid API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here

# 2. Wrong provider selected
export PROVIDER=openai  # Make sure this matches your key

# 3. API key expired or revoked
# Check your provider's dashboard and regenerate if needed
```

### Connection Problems

```bash
# If Claude Code can't connect to CCProxy:

# 1. Check CCProxy is running
curl http://localhost:3456/health

# 2. Verify Claude Code configuration
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=NOT_NEEDED

# 3. Check firewall settings (if needed)
```
