**For Technical Users:**
CCProxy provides the flexibility to switch between AI models based on your specific needs, whether you need current information (Grok) or structured analysis (Claude).

> **Claude Code Pro Tip:** Start with simple queries to understand how Grok responds differently than other AI models. Its conversational style and real-time information access make it particularly valuable for research, content creation, and trend analysis.

## Getting Started: Setting Up Grok with Claude Code

### Simple Setup Process

Getting started with Grok and Claude Code through CCProxy is straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Get Your XAI API Key**
1. Visit [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Generate an API key
4. Note your API key for the next step

**Step 2: Install CCProxy**
CCProxy is the bridge that connects Claude Code to Grok. Installation is simple:
