- Go version: 1.21
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Start ccproxy with default config
2. Send request with 50k tokens
3. Enable streaming in request

### Expected Behavior

2. **Explain the use case** and benefits
3. **Consider alternatives** you've explored
4. **Be specific** about the implementation

### Submitting Pull Requests

#### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ccproxy.git
cd ccproxy
git remote add upstream https://github.com/orchestre-dev/ccproxy.git
```

#### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Or for fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

#### 3. Make Changes

Follow our coding standards:

```go
// Package comment is required
// Package router handles request routing logic
package router

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    
    // Standard library first
    // Then external packages
    // Then internal packages
    "github.com/orchestre-dev/ccproxy/internal/config"
)

// RouterService handles routing decisions
type RouterService struct {
    config *config.Config
}

// NewRouterService creates a new router service
// It accepts a configuration and returns a configured service
func NewRouterService(cfg *config.Config) (*RouterService, error) {
    if cfg == nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("config is required")
    }
    
    return &RouterService{
        config: cfg,
    }, nil
}

// SelectProvider chooses the best provider for a request
func (s *RouterService) SelectProvider(ctx context.Context, req Request) (string, error) {
    // Always check context first
    if err := ctx.Err(); err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("context cancelled: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Implementation
    return s.selectProvider(req)
}
```

#### 4. Write Tests

All code must have tests:

```go
func TestNewRouterService(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        config  *config.Config
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid config",
            config:  &config.Config{},
            wantErr: false,
        },
        {
            name:    "nil config",
            config:  nil,
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            svc, err := NewRouterService(tt.config)
            if tt.wantErr {
                assert.Error(t, err)
                assert.Nil(t, svc)
            } else {
                assert.NoError(t, err)
                assert.NotNil(t, svc)
            }
        })
    }
}
```
