# CCProxy: Use Any AI Model with Claude Code

Hey everyone! I wanted to share something that's been a game-changer for my development workflow.

I've been using Claude Code for months, but sometimes I wanted to try different AI models for specific tasks - Groq for ultra-fast responses, OpenAI for certain capabilities, or local models for privacy.

The problem? Claude Code only works with Anthropic's API format. Until now.

## What is CCProxy?

CCProxy is an open-source proxy that lets you use any AI provider with Claude Code. It translates between different API formats, so you can:

- Use Groq's lightning-fast Llama models
- Access Kimi K2 (the new hottest model) 
- Try OpenAI's GPT-4 or local Ollama models
- Keep your familiar Claude Code interface

## Real Example

Instead of this complexity:
```bash
# Different tools for different providers
curl -X POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions...
curl -X POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions...
```

You get this simplicity:
```bash
# Configure any provider
export PROVIDER=groq
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
ccproxy &

# Use Claude Code as normal
claude "help me debug this function"
```

## Why This Matters

- **No vendor lock-in**: Switch between providers instantly
- **Cost optimization**: Use cheaper providers when appropriate
- **Speed benefits**: Groq responses in under 500ms
- **Privacy options**: Run local models via Ollama

The tool is completely free and open-source. I've been using it for a few weeks and it's saved me both time and money.

Has anyone else been looking for something like this? Would love to hear your thoughts on multi-provider AI workflows.

# Breaking: Use Kimi K2 with Claude Code (Game Changer)

The AI community has been buzzing about Moonshot AI's Kimi K2 model lately. The performance benchmarks are impressive:

- 53.7% on LiveCodeBench (vs GPT-4's 44.7%)
- 97.4% on MATH-500 (vs GPT-4's 92.4%)
- Sub-second inference via Groq

But here's the catch - most of us are used to Claude Code's interface, and Kimi K2 uses different API formats.

## The Solution

I've been testing CCProxy, an open-source tool that bridges this gap. It lets you use Kimi K2 (and other models) with Claude Code's familiar interface.

The setup is surprisingly simple:
```bash
export PROVIDER=groq
export GROQ_MODEL=moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct
ccproxy &

export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7187
claude "analyze this algorithm for time complexity"
```

## What Makes This Interesting

1. **Performance**: Kimi K2's speed through Groq is genuinely impressive
2. **Accessibility**: No need to learn new tools or interfaces  
3. **Flexibility**: Switch between models based on task requirements
4. **Cost**: Often more economical than premium options

## Real Use Cases I've Tested

- Code review and optimization (excellent results)
- Algorithm analysis (very strong performance)
- Documentation generation (surprisingly good)
- Debugging assistance (fast and accurate)

The combination of Kimi K2's capabilities with Claude Code's polished interface has been genuinely useful for my workflow.

Anyone else experimenting with different model combinations? What's been your experience with Kimi K2?

**Title**: Using other AI models with Claude Code? Now possible with CCProxy

Hey everyone! Long-time Claude Code user here. I wanted to share something that's been incredibly useful for my workflow.

## Background

I love Claude Code's interface and tool ecosystem, but sometimes I want to experiment with other models:
- Groq for ultra-fast responses during development sprints
- Local Ollama models for privacy-sensitive projects  
- OpenAI models for specific capabilities
- The new Kimi K2 that everyone's been talking about

The problem was each provider has different APIs, so I'd need different tools and lose my familiar Claude Code workflow.

## Solution: CCProxy

I discovered (and have been testing) CCProxy - an open-source proxy that translates between different AI API formats. It lets you use any supported AI provider while keeping Claude Code's interface exactly the same.

## How it works

1. CCProxy acts as a translation layer
2. Claude Code thinks it's talking to Anthropic's API
3. CCProxy converts requests to your chosen provider (Groq, OpenAI, etc.)
4. Responses get converted back to Claude's expected format
5. You get the response in Claude Code as normal

## Setup Example

```bash
# Use Groq's fast inference
export PROVIDER=groq
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
ccproxy &

# Configure Claude Code to use the proxy
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7187
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=NOT_NEEDED

# Use Claude Code normally - now it's using Groq!
claude "help me optimize this algorithm"
```

## My Experience

**Pros:**
- Zero learning curve (same Claude Code interface)
- Groq responses are genuinely fast (sub-second)
- Can optimize costs by choosing appropriate models
- Provider redundancy (if one is down, switch to another)
- Local model support for sensitive projects

**Cons:**
- Extra setup step (though it's simple)
- One more service to manage
- Some provider-specific features might not translate perfectly

## Supported Providers

Currently supports: Groq, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Ollama, OpenRouter, XAI, and more

## Why I'm sharing this

The project is completely free and open-source. It's not trying to replace Claude or Claude Code - it's about giving us more flexibility while keeping the tools we love.

I think the AI landscape benefits when we have choices rather than vendor lock-in.

**Title**: [R] CCProxy: Open-source proxy enabling Claude Code integration with multiple AI providers

## Abstract

Sharing an open-source project that addresses API compatibility between Claude Code and various AI providers through real-time request/response translation.

## Problem Statement

Claude Code provides an excellent interface for AI-assisted development but is limited to Anthropic's API format. Other providers (Groq, OpenAI, local models) use different API structures, creating workflow fragmentation for researchers and developers who want to experiment across providers.

## Solution Architecture

CCProxy implements a translation layer that:
1. Receives Anthropic-format requests from Claude Code
2. Converts requests to target provider's API format
3. Forwards requests to chosen provider
4. Translates responses back to Anthropic format
5. Returns responses to Claude Code

This approach maintains interface consistency while enabling provider flexibility.

## Technical Implementation

- **Language**: Go (for performance and concurrency)
- **API Translation**: Bidirectional format conversion between Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible formats
- **Tool Support**: Function calling translation across providers
- **Providers**: Groq, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Ollama, OpenRouter, XAI

## Performance Characteristics

Initial testing shows:
- Minimal latency overhead (~5-10ms translation time)
- Memory efficient (~10-20MB runtime footprint)  
- Handles concurrent requests effectively
- Provider-specific performance benefits (e.g., Groq's sub-second inference)

## Use Cases for ML Research

1. **Model Comparison**: Easy A/B testing between providers using identical interfaces
2. **Cost Optimization**: Dynamic provider selection based on task complexity/budget
3. **Latency Sensitivity**: Fast inference for interactive development (Groq integration)
4. **Privacy Requirements**: Local model deployment via Ollama for sensitive research
5. **Provider Redundancy**: Backup options during service outages

## Repository and Documentation

- **Code**: https://github.com/orchestre-dev/ccproxy
- **Docs**: https://ccproxy.orchestre.dev
- **License**: Open source (Apache 2.0)

## Discussion

Interested in community feedback on:
1. Additional provider integrations that would be valuable
2. Performance optimization opportunities
3. Research use cases we haven't considered

The goal is democratizing access to multiple AI capabilities without vendor lock-in or workflow disruption.

Has anyone worked on similar API translation challenges? What approaches have been most effective?
