2. During Anthropic outages/limits, configure backup provider  
3. Claude Code continues working identically
4. Switch back to Claude when service is restored
5. Zero workflow disruption throughout

Example During Service Issues

# When Claude is having problems, configure backup:
export PROVIDER=groq
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_backup_key
ccproxy &

# Point Claude Code to backup (same interface)
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7187

# Continue coding exactly like normal
claude "help optimize this algorithm"

# Switch back to Claude when service is restored

Personal Impact

This setup has eliminated productivity losses during:

Title: [R] CCProxy: Open-source proxy enabling Claude Code integration with multiple AI providers

Abstract

Sharing an open-source project that addresses API compatibility between Claude Code and various AI providers through real-time request/response translation.

Problem Statement

Claude Code provides an excellent interface for AI-assisted development but is limited to Anthropic's API format. Other providers (Groq, OpenAI, local models) use different API structures, creating workflow fragmentation for researchers and developers who want to experiment across providers.

Solution Architecture

CCProxy implements a translation layer that:
1. Receives Anthropic-format requests from Claude Code
2. Converts requests to target provider's API format
3. Forwards requests to chosen provider
4. Translates responses back to Anthropic format
5. Returns responses to Claude Code

This approach maintains interface consistency while enabling provider flexibility.

Technical Implementation

- Language: Go (for performance and concurrency)
- API Translation: Bidirectional format conversion between Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible formats
- Tool Support: Function calling translation across providers
- Providers: Groq, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Ollama, OpenRouter, XAI

Performance Characteristics

Initial testing shows:
- Minimal latency overhead (~5-10ms translation time)
- Memory efficient (~10-20MB runtime footprint)  
- Handles concurrent requests effectively
- Provider-specific performance benefits (e.g., Groq's sub-second inference)

Use Cases for ML Research

1. Model Comparison: Easy A/B testing between providers using identical interfaces
2. Cost Optimization: Dynamic provider selection based on task complexity/budget
3. Latency Sensitivity: Fast inference for interactive development (Groq integration)
4. Privacy Requirements: Local model deployment via Ollama for sensitive research
5. Provider Redundancy: Backup options during service outages

Repository and Documentation

- Code: https://github.com/orchestre-dev/ccproxy
- Docs: https://ccproxy.orchestre.dev
- License: Open source (Apache 2.0)

Discussion

Interested in community feedback on:
1. Additional provider integrations that would be valuable
2. Performance optimization opportunities
3. Research use cases we haven't considered

The goal is democratizing access to multiple AI capabilities without vendor lock-in or workflow disruption.

Has anyone worked on similar API translation challenges? What approaches have been most effective?

- Groq for fast, simple queries (much cheaper)
- Premium models only for complex tasks
- Local models for sensitive data
- ~$80/month for same usage patterns

Why This Matters for Entrepreneurs

Cost Control: Choose the most cost-effective model for each task
Speed: Some providers (like Groq) respond in under 500ms
Reliability: Provider redundancy reduces business risk
Privacy: Option to use local models for confidential data
Future-Proofing: Not dependent on one company's decisions

Business Model Insights

I'm open-sourcing this because:
1. Community Building: Developers appreciate tools that increase their flexibility
2. Market Education: Helps normalize multi-provider AI strategies  
3. Ecosystem Development: Creates opportunities for complementary services
4. Talent Attraction: Demonstrates technical capabilities to potential collaborators

Traction So Far

- 500+ GitHub stars in first month
- Active community contributing new provider integrations
- Several companies adopting for internal development workflows
- Interest from AI service providers wanting integration

The Broader Opportunity

The AI tool market is fragmenting quickly. Tools that provide flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in will become increasingly valuable as the space matures.
